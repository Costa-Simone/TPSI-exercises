-navbar-expand-md — This denotes at which point the navigation bar expands from vertical or hamburger icon to a full-size horizontal bar. In this case, we have set it to medium screens, 
			which, in Bootstrap, is anything greater than 768px.
-navbar-brand — This is used for your website branding. You can also include a logo image file here.
-navbar-toggler — Denotes the toggle button for the collapsed menu. The piece data-toggle="collapse" defines that this will turn to a hamburger menu, 
			not to drop-down, which is the other option. It’s important that you define a data-target with a CSS id (defined by the #) and 
			wrap a <div> with the same name around the actual navbar element.
-navbar-toggler-icon — As you can probably guess, this creates the icon users click on to open the menu on smaller screens.
-navbar-nav — The class for the <ul> list element that holds the menu items. The latter are denoted with nav-item and nav-link.
