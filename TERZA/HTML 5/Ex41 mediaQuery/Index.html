        <h1>andreas00 - a free website template!</h1>
		<div>This template could have been called "andreas01 - v2.0", because that 
			is what it really is. I have taken my most popular website template and added the most requested features, such as a 2-column layout variation and support for sub-pages in the main menu. But I have also made other small modifications and added a few extras, like the background images in the menu buttons. I hope that you like what you see and that you find the template to be easy to work with. That is what it was made for!	
		</div>
		<div><img src="img/test.jpg">This template is released as open source, which
			means that you are free to use it in any way you may want to without any obligations, limitations or fees. I kindly ask that you leave the credits and the link to my website in the footer since it is a nice way of giving something back to me. But it is only a request, not any obligation.
		</div>
        <h1>Other versions and additional resources</h1>
		<div>
			This template is also available as a theme for WordPress and it has been ported to a number of other blogs and CMS as well. New theme versions will be announced on my website whenever a new port is released.
